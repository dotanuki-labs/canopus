# canopus

> A fast and pragmatic validator for Github Codeowners

`canopus` is a small, fast and standalone CLI tool for validating
[Github Codeowners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
written in pure Rust.

Unlike other competing tools, `canopus` brings configuration options
to encourage good practices on code ownership, especially on large
multimodular projects or monorepos.
